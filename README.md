# IoT-Radio Frequency Meter

Build a demo IoT rf meter using Arduino hardware modules and Blynk IOT Cloud. Reads temperature, humidity and RF signal data from sensors. Leverages IoT, Blynk Cloud, and serial monitor.
Code is well commented for easier editing.

Here are the list of modules used in this project:

* Arduino Uno (ATMega328P) or any Atmel compatible microcontroller.
* DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor.
* LM35 temperature sensor for a wide range of temperature.
* SIM800L for GPRS connection and IoT.
* LCD 1602 (16 x 2 LCD) for user data display.
